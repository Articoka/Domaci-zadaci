(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)<br>
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)<br>
What you say?<br>
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)<br>
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)<br></p>
<p>
Woah Woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean,<br>
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen.<br>
I guess if you said so<br>
I'd have to pack my things and go. (That's right)<br></p>
<p>
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)<br>
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)<br>
What you say?<br>
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)<br>
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)<br></p>
<p>
Now baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this-a way<br>
Cause I'll be back on my feet some day.<br>
(Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood)<br>
(you ain't got no money you just ain't no good.)<br>
Well, I guess if you say so<br>
I'd have to pack my things and go. (That's right)</p>
<p>
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)<br>
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)<br>
What you say?<br>
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more.)<br>
(Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more.)</p>
<p>
Well<br>
(don't you come back no more.)<br>
Uh, what you say?<br>
(don't you come back no more.)<br>
I didn't understand you<br>
(don't you come back no more.)<br>
You can't mean that<br>
(don't you come back no more.)<br>
Oh, now baby, please<br>
(don't you come back no more.)<br>
What you tryin' to do to me?<br>
(don't you come back no more.)<br>
Oh, don't treat me like that<br>
(don't you come back no more.)
